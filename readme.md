# pizzaSuch: create your own pizza

pizzaSuch is a fake pizza ordering app

- Choose among a wide variety of ingredients
- Create your own pizza
- Not feeling creative? Just pick one of the standard pizzas, they're all great!

# Technologies used

- React (with hooks)
- Redux
- React Query
- Tailwind
- Also: MercadoPago API (payment processor), Google Places API (address autocomplete/validation), React Hook Forms

# How to Install and Run the Project

- install dependencies

```
npm i
```

in order to make the payment processor work, you'll need to run a simple MercadoPago backend. You can either make one yourself or use [my quick and dirty test implementation](https://github.com/asucho3/mercadopago)

after that's done, you can run the project locally by simply entering into the terminal:

```
npm run dev
```
